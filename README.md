SQL Data Analysis â€“ OLA Ride Booking Dataset

This project involved designing and managing a relational database for analyzing ride bookings in Bengaluru. The dataset consisted of 100,000+ rows, including booking details, ride status, customer behavior, payment methods, and ratings.

Key Objectives & Insights:

ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling & Database Creation: Structured a SQL database for ride-booking records, including customer and driver interactions.

ðŸ”¹ Data Extraction & Analysis: Queried the dataset to identify trends in successful bookings, cancellations, and incomplete rides.

ðŸ”¹ Aggregations & Performance Metrics: Computed average ride distances, customer and driver ratings, and booking values.

ðŸ”¹ Cancellation & Behavior Analysis: Investigated reasons for ride cancellations by both customers and drivers.

ðŸ”¹ Payment Trends: Filtered rides based on payment methods to assess UPI usage patterns.

Key SQL Techniques Used:

âœ… SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, COUNT, AVG, SUM for analysis

âœ… JOINs and Views for data organization

âœ… Filtering & Conditional Statements to extract meaningful insights

âœ… Database Management & Optimization for querying large datasets

This project enhanced my ability to handle real-world datasets, optimize SQL queries, and derive business insights from structured data.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: MySQL / PostgreSQL, SQL Queries, Data Aggregation

Would love to hear feedback or connect with professionals working in SQL, Data Analytics, and Business Intelligence!
